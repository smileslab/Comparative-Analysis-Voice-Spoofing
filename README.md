This is the implementation of our work titled "Voice Spoofing Countermeasures: Taxonomy, State-of-the-art, experimental analysis of generalizability, open challenges, and the way forward," which was available on arxiv at "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00417".

We are using the audio signals from distinct datasets (ASVspoof2019, ASVspoof2021, and VSDC) as input and perform feature extraction with different classifiers (SVM, GMM, CNN, CNN-GRU). We performed cross-corpus evaluation for generalized countermeasures for better discrimination of genuine samples from fake ones.

The datasets can be downloaded from the following links:
